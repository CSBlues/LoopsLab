# Loops Lab
Complete the tasks in the comments in Main.java.

- Write the method `countFactors` which accepts an integer and returns
the count of the number of factors of the input parameter.
   
- Write the method `isPrime` which accepts an integer and returns if
it is a prime number. `isPrime` should call `countFactors`.

- Write the method `printTwoDigits` which takes an int parameter (n) and 
prints n random numbers between 10 and 19. `printTwoDigits` should also print
whether the value 13 was printed.
